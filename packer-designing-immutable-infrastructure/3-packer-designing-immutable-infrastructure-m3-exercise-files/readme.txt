Hello awesome infrastructure person!

Don't forget that you need to set these two environment variables with your own AWS credentials before running these templates:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Also, I've included the source for Globalmantics middle-tier app in Go, in case you want to customize it yourself. The built binary in the ToUpload folder was built for Linux amd64.

Happy Packering!

Paul
